## Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

- [YimMenu](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/grand-theft-auto-v/476972-yimmenu-1-69-b3351.html)
- An injector. i.e [Xenos Injector](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/general-programming-and-reversing/124013-xenos-injector-v2-3-2-a.html)

## Instructions

1. **Set up the menu, install LUA.**

   **I won't be providing help or any instructions on installing YimMenu.**
    Drag the .lua file into YimMenu's scripts folder. This is also accessible in the menu itself.
    Settings -> Lua Scripts -> Open Lua Scripts Folder

2. **Load into online and run the script**

   Once you've set everything up, load up GTA:O, go out onto the streets and click the Reload All button in YimMenu.
   The LUA should be automatically loaded.

   Navigate to **Network -> Whole Lotta Money** and click **Add Money (~$50M)** once you're ready. This might take a while.

    You are only able to get money from this every 4-5 minutes (maybe a bit faster, more testing needed), and is really risky.

3. **Profit**

    You are now rich. Enjoy your account, it only has 3 days left.
